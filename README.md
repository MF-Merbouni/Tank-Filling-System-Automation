# Tank-Filling-System-Automation
Simulation of an automated tank filling and draining system using Ladder Logic and Structured Text

> **Note**:This project simulates a basic **tank filling and draining system** using **PLC programming** in both **Structured Text (ST)** and **Ladder Logic (LD)**. It includes auto/manual modes, safety interlocks, and a simple HMI visualization.

## Features

-  Gradual tank filling using a pump
-  Manual and automatic control modes
-  Safety interlock to prevent simultaneous filling and draining
-  Alarm indication and full/empty level detection
-  Timer-based filling and draining with visual animation (HMI)
-  Value scaling for HMI height animation
-  Display of fill level as a percentage on screen
