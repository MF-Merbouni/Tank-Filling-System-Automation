# Tank-Filling-System-Automation
Simulation of an automated tank filling and draining system using Ladder Logic and Structured Text
This project simulates a basic **tank filling and draining system** using **PLC programming** in both **Structured Text (ST)** and **Ladder Logic (LD)**. It includes auto/manual modes, safety interlocks, and a simple HMI visualization.
